# zigway

A game inspired by ZigZag[1], developed using pygame.  
I always wanted to start with game programming. Got to know about pygame and to start with, I chose to write a game which resembles ZigZag (well, almost). This is only to gain experience in game-programming, I won't be publishing it for various platforms. Hope Marius Gerlich (Copyright holder of ZigZag and Mauigo games) does not sue me for this :p.  

Watch [gameplay demo on youtube](https://youtu.be/mtmmJVBvsCk)  

Pre-requisites: 
  - Python 2.7
  - Pygame

Windows users might already have pygame installed with python.  
Linux users can install pygame by
```
sudo apt-get install python-pygame
```

To run it, clone (or download and extract) the repository and run it through terminal:
```
cd zigway
python zigway.py
```
